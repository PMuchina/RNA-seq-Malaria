#### ASBCB Omics Codeathon team: Lead/Technical: Lambert Nzungize, - Co-Lead/Technical: Kengne Ouafo Jonas Arnaud - Writers: Rissy Makhokha, Peter Kimani, Ken Mugambi
## 1.	Introduction 

Malaria strongly predisposes children in malaria endemic zones to bacteremia. The clinical diagnosis of malaria and bacteremia infections is a challenge to the clinicians due to the overlapping of the symptoms. There is a potential risk of misdiagnosi. Next-generation RNA sequencing hold a great promise in providing a sensitive method for global gene expression analysis. Differential gene expression analysis could differentiate the etiologies of febrile children if is either malaria or bacteremia. Ultimately, a unique biomarker signature for  patients co-infected with malaria and bacteremia could be derived.In this case, dual RNA-seq quantifies RNA transcripts of of blood for patients co-infected with malaria and bacteremia.
* What is coinfection of Malaria with bacteremia?
*	What's to exist problem?
*	How should we solve it through RNA seq data analysis?
* What does dual RNA seq Do?
